<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The audio settings dialog
  lets you change the audio output device used by SigmaTizm. The list
  of devices is generated based on the sound devices available on your system. Selecting
a device from the list will switch to it immediately.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every sound device has
a different latency, which is the amount of time between hitting a key and hearing
sound. Some devices may have more than one driver with different latency values (for instance,
ASIO drivers, WDM drivers, and MME drivers for the same device have different
latency). You should choose the driver with the lowest latency if available, otherwise
there could be a delay when you play a note, and this delay makes it much harder to
play an instrument.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some drivers also require exclusive
  access to the audio hardware, so you will not be able to use other audio apps when that
  driver is selected, or the selected driver may fail to activate when another
  audio app is running (this includes playing video or audio content in your web browser). This
  tends to be true of ASIO drivers, which are very fast, but also very greedy.
