    <em>A Virtual Additive Synthesizer</em><br>
    Version 1.01</font></p>
</center>
<p align="center"><a href="fulldlg.htm"><img src="SigmatizmSmall.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SigmaTizm is an additive 
  synthesizer with 128 harmonic oscillators. For more about how additive synthesis works, 
  you can read <a href="additive.htm">this intro</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can be controlled using 
  the keys of your computer keyboard, with each row of keys representing a different 
  octave. A key will light up with a red circle when its note is playing. It can 
  also be controlled with the mouse or via an external MIDI keyboard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Harmonics Editor</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The top left portion of 
  the window is the harmonics editor. This is where you define the timbre of the 
  sound the synthesizer will play. SigmaTizm supports 128 oscillators, 
  with each bar representing a harmonic. The first bar represents the base frequency of the key being
played, the second bar 2x that frequency, the third 3x that frequency, and so on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Clicking in the harmonics editor will change the level for a particular harmonic and 
 right-clicking will clear that  harmonic.
If notes are playing, you should hear the change in timbre. In addition, 
  the changes should be reflected in either the 'attack' or 'sustain' waveform 
  preview. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can also left-click 
  and drag to draw harmonics and right-click and drag to erase harmonics. Doing 
  this while a note is playing will let you morph the sound in realtime for interesting 
  filter effects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The harmonics editor starts 
  with a simple plain vanilla sine wave fundamental in both the attack and sustain 
  phases of sound generation. You can change these two sets of harmonics independently 
  by clicking the &quot;Attack&quot; button to edit attack harmonics and the &quot;Sustain&quot; 
  button to edit sustain harmonics. If you want to copy from one panel to the 
  other, the arrow buttons between the &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Sustain&quot; 
  buttons will let you do so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you would like to start 
  building with the harmonic series for a standard waveform (square, triangle, etc.) you can select it 
  from the waveform list and click the &quot;Generate&quot; button. The panel 
  will then contain the harmonic series for that waveform at levels appropriate 
  for the &quot;Target Polyphony&quot; setting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Target Polyphony&quot; 
  setting controls overall volume levels when generating or normalizing waveforms 
  and is meant to determine the number of notes you can safely play without distortion. 
  The &quot;Safe Polyphony&quot; number is an indicator of the number of notes 
  that can be played simultaneously without &quot;annoying&quot; the soft limiter 
  and is the maximum number of notes that can be played without the total peak 
  level adding up to 1.0. Beyond that level, there is the danger of "clipping" which flattens
  the peaks of the output sound, whicn is often (but not always) undesirable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clcking the &quot;Normalize&quot; 
  buttons will re-scale the harmonics in the editor window to more closely match 
  the target polyphony level. This can be used to easily increase or decrease 
  the overall volume of a sound you have created.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Clear&quot; button 
  removes all harmonics from the editor window.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The slider to the right 
  of the window controls the &quot;zoom level&quot; of the harmonics window and 
  lets you edit lower-level harmonics in greater detail. The number above the 
  slider will show the maximum harmonic level for that zoom level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Envelope Settings</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The envelope settings let 
  you control a standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope for SigmaTizm. 
  By default the attack time and decay time are both zero, which means notes will 
  go into sustain phase as soon as they are played. If you want to hear both the 
  attack and sustain portions of your harmonic series you will have to increase 
  the attack and/or decay values.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The attack time is the amount 
  of time it takes to go from zero to full volume. The decay time is the amount 
  of time it takes to go from full volume to sustain volume. The sustain volume 
  is a percent of max volume to sustain sounds at, and the release time is the 
  amount of time it takes a sound to decay after the note stops playing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attack and decay settings 
  have a maximum time of 1 second, while release has a maximum time of 1/2 second. All slider time 
values are in milliseconds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When playing notes, the 
  attack harmonic will start playing at zero volume. It will gradually increase 
  in volume until the attack time is reached, then it will gradually decrease 
  in volume toward the sustain level for the duration of the decay time. During 
  this time, the harmonics that are playing will gradually transform from the 
  attack harmonics to the sustain harmonics. If the attack and decay time are 
  zero, then the harmonic transformation does not take place and the sustain harmonic 
  plays immediately. If the sustain level is set at 100, then the volume level 
  does not decrease during the decay phase. When a note is released, it will continue 
  playing the sustain harmonics at lower volumes until the release time is reached.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because harmonics switch 
  to sustain harmonics when a note is released, there can be a pop or click sound 
  if the entire attack-decay phase has not completed and the synthesizer is still 
  transforming harmonics from attack to release. With very short attack and decay 
  times this will not happen, but with long ones it will happen when playing and 
  releasing notes quickly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, if the release 
  time is set to 0, sound will cut off immediately when a note is released, which 
  will almost always result in a pop or static sound. This may or may not be desirable. 
  If it is not, keeping the release time at 10 milliseconds or so will prevent 
  it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>LFO Settings</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The low-frequency oscillator 
  is an oscillator that can be used to add vibrato to sounds that are playing. 
  The range is from 0 to 20 oscillations per second with a resolution of a tenth 
  of a second. The vibrato waveform can be changed, and the modulation wheel will 
  control the depth (intesity) of the vibrato.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Keyboard</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The keyboard is both a controller 
  and indicator of notes playing. When a note is playing, its key will show a 
  red dot. Notes can be triggered by clicking on them, by typing on the computer 
  keyboard, or by using an external MIDI controller.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If playing via the mouse, 
  notes will release as soon as the mouse button is released. in the &quot;main&quot; 
  part of the window. However, if the mouse is released in the &quot;harmonics&quot; 
  section of the synth -- which includes the harmonics editor panel and the peak 
  and polyphony info section below it -- then notes will continue to play. You 
  will need to do this if you want to keep notes playing while you tinker with 
  the harmonics. Another interesting thing to note is that if you have multiple 
  notes playing, right-clicking a lit note will deactivate it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When playing notes with 
  the keyboard, each row of keys will represent a different octave with the function 
  keys F1 through F12 being the lowest octave and row of keys starting with Z 
  being the highest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>CPU Usage</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additive synthesis is notorious for requiring a lot of CPU power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depending on synthesizer 
  settings, each note that is playing can take as many as 35 million calculations 
  per second. At a sample rate of 44100 samples per second and with 128 harmonic 
  oscillators, SigmaTizm has to do a large amount of math, especially when you 
  figure in calculating volume envelope and interpolation of harmonics from attack 
  to sustain phase and the LFO. If you find your system slowing down and generating 
  choppy sound, the two things that will reduce CPU usage the most will be playing 
  fewer notes or using fewer harmonics in the sounds you have created.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Generating one of the 'canned' 
  waveforms like square, triangle, or saw will result in the creation of either 
  64 or 128 harmonics. Since the highest harmonics will not normally be audible 
  or will create aliasing sounds, it may be a good idea to erase them (right-click 
  and drag in the harmonics editor) to save CPU cycles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Other Controls</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Bank&quot; and 
  &quot;Patch&quot; spinners are used for changing patches on an external MIDI 
  device. They will only function if MIDI output is enabled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exclamation point icon 
  is a &quot;panic&quot; button that turns all MIDI notes off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The info button shows the 
  about box.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're reading this you 
  know what the question mark does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The icon that looks like 
  a MIDI connector lets you change <a href="midi.htm">MIDI settings</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wrench icon lets you 
  choose which sound device to use for output. SigmaTizm will use your primary 
  audio device by default, but you can use any of your ASIO, DirectSound, or MME 
  devices for output as long as they support standard CD-quality output.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The disk and folder icons 
  let you save and load patches, respectively. This is so you can save sounds 
  you have created for later recall. SigmaTizm comes with a few built-in patches 
  as examples of sounds that can be created.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two bars at the right 
  are the peak level indicator. They let you know how loud the playing sounds 
  are in relation to the maximum. If the peak indicators are more than about three-quarters 
  full you will be getting some distortion from the synthesizer due to built in 
  soft-limiting. This may or may not be desirable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first vertical slider 
  at the left of the keyboard is the pitch wheel. It will change the pitch of 
  the synthesizer by two semitones in either direction and also works for control 
  of external MIDI devices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second vertical slider 
  is the modulation wheel, which is used for mixing in vibrato from the LFO.</font></p>
