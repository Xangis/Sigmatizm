<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Additive Synthesis
  Overview</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An additive synthesizer
  works by adding together sine wave oscillators at different frequencies to generate
  sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mathematician Joseph
  Fourier discovered that all periodic sounds could be created by adding together
  sine waves at different frequencies. For his theory he used an infinite number
  of sine waves, but since computers can't generate an infinite number of sine
  waves in real-time, it's usually safe to restrict those to audible frequencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Harmonic additive synthesis
  works by only using harmonics -- frequencies that are a multiple of the root,
  or fundamental tone being played. If you are playing an A note at 110 Hertz
  (cycles per second), then harmonics of that note will be at even multiples of
  that frequency -- 220Hz, 330Hz, 440Hz, 550Hz, and so on. By setting the loudness
  of each of these harmonics you can create sounds that have a certain timbre
  when all of the harmonics are added together. This is the method used by SigmaTizm
  and most other additive synthesizers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, it is typical
  for a timbre to change over time, with different tonal characteristics during
  the attack (when a string is plucked or a bell struck) versus when a note is
  being sustained (ringing or resonating). Most additive synthesizers will give
  you a way to transition from an attack sound of a certain timbre to a sustain
  sound of a different timbre. SigmaTizm lets you do this by specifying the attack
  and sustain harmonics separately via the harmonics editor window.</font></p>
